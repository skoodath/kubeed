          What are the prices of these courses?
        </Faq.Question>

      <Faq.Answer margins>
        Since these courses are hosted on Udemy, so pricing varies based on
        where you are located. However, I tried making it economical and
        consistent by creating a special price for students accessing the above
        courses from this site. It will also help us save the commission fee
        from Udemy.
      </Faq.Answer>
      <Faq.Answer>
        For example, if you are accessing any of the courses using the above
        coupon code link, and if you are located in the U.S, it will be around
        $12.99, and if you are in India, it will be about â‚¹570.

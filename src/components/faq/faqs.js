    question: "What's the difference between your courses on Udemy and the ones on kubex?",
    answer: `There is no difference. The courses are exactly the same. 
            If you go directly to Udemy and purchase one of our courses we get around $5 per sale, 
            but if you go via one of the links here then we get around $9 per sale.`

      question: "What do I need to do your courses?",
      answer: `All you need is a computer, access to the internet and a willingness to learn. 
                Everything else, we'll walk you through in the course. 
                There is no paid software required.`
